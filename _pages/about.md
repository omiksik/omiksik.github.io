**Hi!** I am a senior scientist at the Microsoft Mixed Reality & AI Lab Zurich, where I spend majority of my time by developing system for cloud-based localization and mapping from crowd-sourced data ([Azure Spatial Anchors](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/spatial-anchors/)).

I believe in synergy between industry and academia and I have been actively developing collaboration with ETH Zurich and other research institutions. Some of the recent (public) outcomes include [benchmarking localization and mapping for augmented reality (LaMAR)](https://lamar.ethz.ch/), [evaluation of robot task planning over large 3D scene graphs (Taskography)](https://taskography.github.io/), [enabling cross-descriptor visual localization and mapping](https://dsmn.ml/publications/cdvlm.html) or [revisiting camera pose estimation by learning to detect scene landmarks](https://github.com/microsoft/SceneLandmarkLocalization).

I did my PhD on semantic segmentation of large-scale 3D environments at the University of Oxford where I was co-advised by [Phil Torr](https://torrvision.com/) and [Patrick Perez](https://ptrckprz.github.io/). I am always looking for interesting research collaborations and ideas, please get in touch and send me an <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">email</a>.
